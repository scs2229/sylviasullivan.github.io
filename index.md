# Research

We are broadly interested in scale interactions in the atmosphere and how best to represent these in weather and climate models in order to build resilience in water-susceptible regions. At the moment, we are focused on mesoscale convective systems as a specific instance of this atmospheric scale problem. Mesoscale convective systems are aggregations of thunderstorms that extend over hundreds of kilometers and bring the majority of extreme rainfall throughout the tropics. Their intermediate size in the spectrum of atmospheric phenomena means that they are influenced by both the smallest scales (like ice crystal or droplet formation, called cloud microphysics) and the largest scales (via circulation patterns like the Hadley cell). We are working to understand the smallest scales through benchtop experimentation and idealized parcel modeling and the largest scales through high-resolution storm-resolving simulations. 

**We are hiring!** We have a **[PhD opening](/Files/PhD-position3-announcement.pdf)** focused on benchtop crystallization experiments and parcel model simulations from Fall 2023. Please email sylvia@arizona.edu with a CV and apply to the UA graduate program in the Department of Chemical & Environmental Engineering through [GrapApp](https://apply.grad.arizona.edu/users/login) if you are interested!
