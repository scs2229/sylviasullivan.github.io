I am currently studying the radiative effects of tropical cirrus in the Asian monsoon region
in the group of Aiko Voigt. We are using high-resolution modeling (the ICON model) both for
idealized and Lagrangian trajectory studies. 

In the past few years, have also used geostationary satellite data to study tropical organized 
convection and associated precipitation differentiated by El Ni√±o phase. And I completed my 
thesis on multi-scale modeling of cloud ice formation, both thermodynamic nucleation and secondary
production processes.
