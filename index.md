I am currently studying the radiative effects of tropical cirrus in the Asian monsoon region
in the group of Aiko Voigt. We are using high-resolution modeling (the ICON model) both for
idealized and Lagrangian trajectory studies. 

In the past few years, have also used geostationary satellite data to study tropical organized 
convection and associated precipitation differentiated by El Ni√±o phase. And I completed my 
thesis on multi-scale modeling of cloud ice formation, both thermodynamic nucleation and secondary
production processes.


# Research

## Satellite climatologies of organized convection

## Parcel and mesoscale modeling of secondary ice production

## Sensitivity and attribution analyses for ice nucleation
Computationally efficient sensitivity and attribution analyses can be performed with automatic differentiation of parameterization codes in large-scale models. The resultant *adjoint model* obviates the need for finite differencing, as an output perturbation is back-propagated through to various input perturbations. I have built adjoints from the ice nucleation codes in the Community Atmosphere Model and the Goddard Earth-Observing model and used these to indentify nucleation regime shifts, quantify aerosol nucleation efficiencies, and define temporal attribution metrics.
