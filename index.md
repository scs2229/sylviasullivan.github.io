I study tropical organized convection, its precipitation, and interaction with circulation 
using satellite data and reanalyses in the research group of Pierre Gentine. In the past, I 
have also worked with cloud microphysics schemes, particularly ice nucleation and secondary 
ice production parameterizations, in global climate models, weather models, and parcel
 frameworks as a student with Athanasios Nenes.
