I am a Young Investigator Fellow at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, studying 
the radiative effects of tropical cirrus in the Asian monsoon region
with Aiko Voigt. We are using high-resolution modeling (the ICON model) both for
idealized and Lagrangian trajectory studies. 

In the past few years, I have also used geostationary satellite data to study tropical organized 
convection and associated precipitation differentiated by El Ni√±o phase. And I completed my 
thesis on multi-scale modeling of cloud ice formation, both thermodynamic nucleation and secondary
production processes.
