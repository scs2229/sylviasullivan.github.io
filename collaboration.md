## Clouds and climate monograph

Over the past two and a half years, I have been organizing an AGU Wiley Geophysical Monograph on clouds and climate, along with Corinna Hoose. We have assembled a great group of authors and structured the contents around themes on radiation, circulation, and precipitation. The volume should appear in the first half of 2022. 

**[Monograph table of contents](/Files/git-toc-v3.pdf)**

The introductory chapter presents analyses of the scientific literautre on clouds and climate ("science of science") and is available on Essoar:
**[Science of cloud and climate science: An analysis of the literature over the past 50 years](https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10510355.1)**

## Hydrological studies

I have been lucky to work with Dr. Jiabo Yin and others at Wuhan University on several hydrological studies, discussing the intensification of runoff, drought, and flooding both globally and in China.
